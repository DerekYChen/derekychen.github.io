title: Tic-Tac-Toe Extended
description: TicTacToe Extended is a variation of the classic game with added complexity and a larger playing board. Play the game <a href="http://www.derekychen.com/TicTacToe-Extended">here</a>! The board looks like a normal tic tac toe board, with a small tic tac toe board in each cell. Win each small board like any other tic tac toe game to mark it with an X or O. Get three small boards in a line to win the game! Here's the twist&#58; the move you make on the small board determines the next small board your opponent plays on, forcing you to consider the state of the small board and the large board at the same time. Currently features two players on the same computer. Read more about the rules and how it was developed <a href="">here</a>.

<p>Tic Tac Toe Extended is my foray into AngularJS. The project can be described as nested tic tac toe - imagine a tic
tac toe board in each cell of a large tic tac toe board. Winning a small board results in a X or O in that cell of the
large grid. Now you may be thinking "how does this differ from normal tic tac toe, albeit repeated a few times?". </p>
<p>The twist is that the small board you play on is determined by your opponents previous move. While sharing the same
fundamentals as tic tac toe, this changes the entire strategy. You cannot focus on winning one small board, you also
have to consider which board you are sending your opponent to. Check it out <a href="http://derekychen.com/TicTacToe-Extended/">here</a>.</p>
