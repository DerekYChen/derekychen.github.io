description: "\"Breaking Balls\" is an autonomous robot I built for ENPH 253. The robot was able to pick up squash balls using the roller at the back, follow black tape towards IR sensors, detect the IR signal and fire the squash balls at a target. All this behaviour was autonomous with no user input. When it ran out of balls, it would tape follow back and pick up more squash balls."

preview: "<p>In the summer of 2012, I took a course called ENPH 253 - Introduction to Instrument Design, but everyone knew it as \"that robot course\". After 8 grueling weeks of 12 hour days in the lab and two all nighters, our autonomous robot \"Breaking Balls\" was born. The robot was able to pick up squash balls using the roller at the back, follow black tape towards IR sensors, detect the IR signal and fire the squash balls at a target. All this behaviour was autonomous with no user input. When it ran out of balls, it would tape follow back and pick up more squash balls.</p>"
